# loan-calculator
This is a loan calculator project created in my JavaScript course by Brad Traversy. This project includes HTML, Bootstrap CDN, and JavaScript.

You enter the loan amount, interest rate, and years it will take to pay. The calculator will calculate your monthly payment, total payment, and total amount of interest you'll pay.
